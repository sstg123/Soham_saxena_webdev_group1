    <h1>What is Coronavirus?</h4>
<p>Coronavirus also known as Sars-Cov-2 or Covid-19 is a deadly disease which impacts your lungs and 
    respiratory system in the body. People affected with Covid-19, might have symptoms like: <br>
<br>
1. Coughing
<br>
2. Fever
<br>
3. Mild respiratory disease.
<br>
<br> Older people with diabetes, cancer, chronic respiratory disease might have more impact from this virus.
The virus spreads through droplets of saliva or cough which comes out from the 
nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes. There are some precautions that you need to take, to stop the spread
of this deadly virus: <br>
<br>
1. Cough with a flexed elbow.
<br>
2. If you experience any of the symptoms above, please take a Covid-19 test or stay isolated at home for 
14 days.
<br>
3. Maintain at least a 1-3 meters distance, if you are meeting anyone. This is social distancing.
<br>
4. Wear a mask if you go outside of your house at all points in time.
<br>
<br>
<br>
Vaccine Update...  

There are about 100 Covid-19 vaccine candidates under development. WHO is trying to collaborate with other 
such labaratories and organizations. When an effective vaccine is found, the COVAX(led by WHO, GAVI and  CEPI), will

My name is Soham Saxena and I am 12 years old. My passion is programming 
and making apps and websites, which spread awareness about pertinent issues which the world is grappling with.
I also love to play badminton, cricket and do swimming. In this lockdown, I have done many thing such as helping my mum in cleaning
the house, cooking and baking cakes dishes for my family and many other things. I have also learnt how to grow a plant and how to take care of it.
I am having online classes this year due to the Covid-19 crisis. The world has been moved by this deadly global killer. I am eager for the vaccine to come out so that 
this virus can be finished off. I pray for the wellbeing and good health of the world.
<br>
<br>
Why I made this website?
<br>
<br>
I have made this website to inform the world about this deadly virus. This global killer has affected the entire world and is continuing to do so. 
Many people, today, forget to wear a mask and maintain social distancing. This website shall help those people and make them aware, that we are not
supposed to take things for granted, in these times. I hope that this virus has a cure and gets the world back in its own original shape!
